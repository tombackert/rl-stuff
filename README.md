# Reinforcement Learning Projects

This repository serves as a collection of projects exploring various aspects of Reinforcement Learning (RL). Each project delves into a specific RL problem and demonstrates the application of popular algorithms, libraries and frameworks. This repository aims for high and simple understanding of basic ideas in RL. Feel free to contribute!

Goals of this repository:
1. Gain a comprehensive understanding of core concepts in RL.
2. Develop practical skills in implementing RL algorithms.
3. High and simple understanding of basic ideas in RL.
4. Build usefull notebooks that enable anybody to quickly try out RL projects.


## 1st Project: Solving the Lunar Lander Problem with Deep Q-Networks (DQN)

This project addresses the classic Lunar Lander problem using the DQN algorithm. The included GIF showcases the trained agent successfully navigating the lunar lander to the landing pad without crashing.

### Project Details:
* **Environment:** LunarLander-v2 [(Gymnasium)](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/box2d/lunar_lander/)
* **Algorithm:** Deep Q-Network [(DQN)](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/modules/dqn.html)
* **Library:** [Stable-Baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html)
* **Hyperparameters:** Tuned for DQN Model [(Baselines3 Zoo)](https://github.com/DLR-RM/rl-baselines3-zoo/blob/master/hyperparams/dqn.yml)
